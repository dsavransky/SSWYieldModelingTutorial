While there is not broad consensus on what exactly makes a planet 'Earth-like', in general, you want these planets to receive about as much radiant flux from their host stars as the Earth receives from the sun. This means that we wish to match insolation distance rather than absolute distance between planet and star. That is, we want to scale our planets' semi-major axes as $a = \\sqrt{L}a_{L=1 L_\\odot}$ where $a_{L=1 L_\\odot}$ is the semi-major axis at 1 solar luminosity. The full range of semi-major axes we wish to study is similarly scaled, leading to a very basic definition of the **habitable zone**.\n","\n","This semi-major axis scaling implies that the orbital radius similarly scales as $r = \\sqrt{L}r_{L=1 L_\\odot}$, meaning that so does the projected separation: $$s = \\sqrt{L}s_{L=1 L_\\odot}$$\n","\n","If you plug these scalings into the $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ expression, you find:\n","$$\\Delta\\mathrm{mag} = \\Delta\\mathrm{mag}_{L=1 L_\\odot} + 2.5\\log_{10}\\left(L\\right)$$\n","\n","Note that there's no need to recompute our underlying joint probability density function for different values of stellar luminosity.  Instead, we only need to re-interpret the axes.

For low stellar luminosities, the habitable zone moves inwards, towards the star, making the requirements on IWA very challenging.  For a fixed IWA, as we're assuming here, eventually the full joint distribution moves outside of the bounding box (at somewhere around 0.06 solar luminosities). For the assumed fixed distance of 10 pc (and our IWA/OWA/limiting $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$) assumptions), we find a peak in the completeness at around 0.65 solar luminosities.  As we continue to increase the luminosity, the habitable zone keeps moving outwards (which makes for easier IWA requirements) but the planets also get fainter (due to the reciprocal orbital radius magnitude term in the $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ equation), making instrumental limiting $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ requirements more challenging. By the time we get to 30 solar luminosities (roughly an A1V star - think just a bit dimmer than Vega), the bounding box has fully moved *below* the joint density function and the completeness is once again zero.\n","\n","Finally, always remember that both the luminosity scaling and stellar distance scaling effects are happening at the same time!\n","\n","# Integration Time\n","\n","You may have noticed a glaring gap in our formulation of how we compute completeness: it appears to be entirely independent of integration (or exposure) time.  This is decidedly non-physical, as, intuitively, we should be able to see fainter planets if we collect more photons.  In reality, the integration time folds into the determination of our limiting $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$.  In order to see how, we first need to define an integration time model.\n","\n","## Signal to Noise Ratio\n","\n","We start by modeling the signal that we collect with our instrument as the sum of the photons from the thing we wish to measure (e.g., a planet, so we'll call this $c_p$) plus the photons from everything else (e.g., the background, so we'll call this $c_b$).  We can equivalently define the rates of photon arrival from each of these sources (which we'll represent with an overbar) such that our total measurement is:\n","$$z = \\bar{c}_pt_\\mathrm{int} +  \\bar{c}_bt_\\mathrm{int}$$\n","\n","We ultimately wish to make a statistical statement about what we thought we detected, which is typically encoded as a **signal to noise** (SNR) metric (or ratio).  SNR actually has *a lot* of formal definitions, which vary by field and application area, but the one most useful in our case is the ratio of the expectation value of the signal (the thing we wish to measure) to the standard deviation of the noise (everything else).  Photon arrival is a Poisson process&mdash;that is, the distribution of photons collected in a given span of time is governed by a Poisson distribution, which describes the probability of recording a certain number of events per unit time when the events have a constant rate of occurrence. One nice attribute of a Poisson distribution is that its standard deviation is equal to the square root of its mean value.\n","\n","So, under all these assumptions, our SNR metric is defined as:\n","$$\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{c}_pt_\\mathrm{int}}{\\sqrt{ \\bar{c}_pt_\\mathrm{int}  + \\bar{c}_bt_\\mathrm{int} }} = \\frac{\\bar{c}_p}{\\sqrt{ \\bar{c}_p  + \\bar{c}_b }} \\sqrt{t_\\mathrm{int}}$$\n","\n","Note that the denominator (the noise term) includes both the planet and background counts.  This is because Poisson noise (sometimes called **shot noise**) is generated by *all* incoming photons.  One immediate observation is that our SNR goes as the square root of integration time. So, if you want to double your SNR, you need to quadruple how long you collect photons for. The other thing to note is that this expression appears to predict that you can get to an arbitrarily high SNR if you are willing to integrate for an arbitrary long time.  This latter assertion is problematic because it is inherently non-physical for every optical system built to date.  In general, there will always be some **noise floor** (typically linked to the inherent stability of the optical system) that means that at a certain integration time, you stop gaining any SNR. Detailed modeling of such a noise floor can be arbitrarily complex, so instead, we will provide ourselves with a simplified model of the form:\n","$$\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{c}_pt_\\mathrm{int}}{\\sqrt{ \\bar{c}_pt_\\mathrm{int}  + \\bar{c}_bt_\\mathrm{int} + (Mt_\\mathrm{int})^2) }}$$\n","where $M$ is a term inherently capturing our system's noise floor.  As $Mt_\\mathrm{int}$ is added to our noise term in quadrature, $M$ can be interpreted as the photon rate associated with the standard deviation of a noise component that fundamentally cannot be subtracted out from our measured signal.\n","\n","Using these definitions, we can now invert the expression to compute integration times as:\n","$$t_\\mathrm{int} = \\frac{ \\bar{c}_p + \\bar{c}_b }{\\left(\\dfrac{\\bar{c}_p}{\\mathrm{SNR}}\\right)^2 - M^2}$$\n","which imposes the condition:\n","$$M < \\frac{ \\bar{c}_p}{\\mathrm{SNR}}$$\n","These last two expressions fundamentally express the idea that for a given optical system and planet and noise count rates, there will be signal to noise ratios that are fundamentally unachievable (which matches our actual experience in real life).\n","\n","## Exercise 6\n","\n","Write a function to compute integration times given input values of $ \\bar{c}_p, \\bar{c}_b$, $M$ and the required SNR."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"6c087a6d-192f-49f4-a34d-edac021767da","metadata":{"id":"6c087a6d-192f-49f4-a34d-edac021767da"},"outputs":[],"source":["def calc_intTime(C_p, C_b, M, SNR):\n","    \"\"\"Find the integration time to reach a required SNR given the planet and\n","    background count rates as well as the optical system's noise floor.\n","\n","\n","    Args:\n","        C_p (arraylike Quantity):\n","            Planet count rate (1/time units)\n","        C_b (arraylike Quantity):\n","            Background count rate (1/time units)\n","        M (arraylike Quantity):\n","            Noise floor count rate (1/time units)\n","        SNR (float):\n","            Required signal to noise ratio\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        ~astropy.units.Quantity(~numpy.ndarray(float)):\n","            Integration times\n","\n","    .. note::\n","\n","        All infeasible integration times should be returned as NaN values\n","\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    # your code goes here:\n","    intTime =\n","\n","\n","    # infinite and negative values are set to NAN\n","    intTime[np.isinf(intTime) | (intTime.value < 0.0)] = np.nan\n","\n","    return intTime\n","\n","# if you get stuck: a reference implementation is available in SSWYieldModelingTutorial.calc_intTime\n","\n","# when you're done, test your function:\n","C_p = 0.03/u.s # planet count rate photons/second (photons excluded from unit)\n","C_b = 0.01/u.s # background count rate photons/second (photons excluded from unit)\n","M = 0.003/u.s # noise floor count rate photons/second (photons excluded from unit)\n","SNR = 5\n","calc_intTime(C_p, C_b, M, SNR)\n","# the expected output is ~1481.5 seconds"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"69674f41-2356-4154-8bf9-651baa2f7587","metadata":{"id":"69674f41-2356-4154-8bf9-651baa2f7587"},"source":["## Modeling Planet and Background Counts\n","\n","Now that we have our SNR and integration time equations, we need to be able to model the individual terms involved, and map them to the quantities that determine completeness. We'll start with the planet count rate.\n","\n","### Planet Count Rate\n","Remember that the $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ encodes the flux ratio of the planet to its host star. Therefore, we can express the spectral flux density (or irradiance) of a planet as $C_\\mathrm{star} 10^{-0.4\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}}$ where $C_\\mathrm{star}$ is the spectral flux density of the star, and -0.4 is the reciprocal of -2.5. We can further define:\n","$$C_\\mathrm{star} = \\mathcal{F}_0 10^{-0.4\\mathrm{mag}_\\mathrm{star}}$$\n","where $\\mathcal{F}_0$ is the spectral flux density (in your observing wavelength band) of a zero-magnitude star, and $\\mathrm{mag}_\\mathrm{star}$ is the apparent magnitude of your target star in that same band.\n","\n","We've now defined the spectral flux density of the planet, but we actually care about the planet count rates recorded on our instrument's detector.  Recall that spectral flux density is energy per time per area per wavelength (thanks to the Planck constant, equivalently photons per time per area per wavelength). In order to compute the planet count rate, we need to scale the spectral flux density by our telescope's collecting area, the wavelength range of our observing band (the bandpass), and any losses due to the optical system.  So, we define:\n","$$\\bar{c}_p =  \\mathcal{F}_0 10^{-0.4(\\mathrm{mag}_\\mathrm{star}+ \\Delta\\mathrm{mag})}A \\Delta\\lambda \\tau \\tau_\\mathrm{core} \\mathrm{QE}$$\n","where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the bandpass of our observing band, $\\tau$ is the throughput of our system due to everything *other* than whatever technology is used to suppress the star's light (that is, all losses due to internal reflections and transmissions), and $\\tau_\\mathrm{core}$ is the throughput of our starlight suppression technology for point sources. $A$ is the effective collecting area of our telescope (e.g. the primary mirror area minus the area of any obscuration), which we compute (for a circular aperture of diameter $D$ and obscuration factor $f_\\mathrm{obsc}$) as:\n","$$A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{D}{2}\\right)^2(1 - f_\\mathrm{obsc})\\,.$$\n","Finally QE is the quantum efficiency of our detector: this is the mean rate at which photons are converted to electrons (which is what ultimately gets measured and recorded). If you're keeping track of units, the application of the QE factor transforms any units of photons to units of electrons.  In real detectors, there's some additional complexity in the digitization of the electron counts to actual recorded counts (typically represented as digital numbers or DN units), but for simplicity we will assume that one electron produces on recorded count value.\n","\n","### Astrophysical Background Count Rates\n","The background signal will include counts from astrophysical sources as well as noise from the instrument itself.  The most important astrophysical background sources are the local zodiacal light ($\\bar{c}_\\mathrm{zodi}$; light reflected form the dust cloud shrouding the inner solar system), exozodiacal light ($\\bar{c}_\\mathrm{exozodi}$; light reflected from similar dust clouds in the target exosystem), and residual starlight not blocked by our starlight suppression technology ($\\bar{c}_{sr}$). We model the local zodiacal light contribution as:\n","$$\\bar{c}_\\mathrm{zodi} = \\mathcal{F}_0 10^{-0.4z} \\Omega A \\Delta\\lambda \\tau \\tau_\\mathrm{occ} \\mathrm{QE}$$\n","where $\\tau_\\mathrm{occ}$ is the throughput of our starlight suppression technology for infinitely extended sources, $z$ is the surface brightness of the local zodi in units of magnitudes per unit solid angle (nominally 23 mag arcsec$^{-2}$), and $\\Omega$ is the solid angle of our photometric aperture. We will assume that our instrument is critically sampled at the central wavelength of our bandpass ($\\lambda$) then we can compute the photometric aperture solid angle as:\n","$$\\Omega = \\pi\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2D}\\right)^2 \\,.$$\n","Note that the unit of this value (if the wavelength and primary diameter have the same length unit) is a steradian (radian^2).  To make this work with the previous expression, we need to convert this to square arcseconds.\n","\n","The exozodi contribution is computed in the exact same way, except that we replace the value of $z$ with whatever we are assuming for the brightness of the exozodi (at this point, we literally don't know what this should be - we haven't built instruments sensitive enough to directly measure this yet)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3d097349-baa3-420e-a062-76699f66e81a","metadata":{"id":"3d097349-baa3-420e-a062-76699f66e81a"},"source":["### Instrumental Background Count Rates\n","\n","Another major source of background signal is due to the planet's host star.  While our starlight suppression technologies are designed to remove light from the star, they cannot do so perfectly, and so there will always be some amount of starlight that makes it into our science images.  We characterize this quantity via our instrument's contrast ($C$): the ratio of off-axis flux (at the location where we're making our measurement) to the peak of the star's flux in a measurement taken *without* the starlight suppression system in place. This value essentially encodes how efficiently we are able to block starlight.  Note that while this value is similar to the $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$, it is inherently an instrumental property whereas $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ is an astrophysical one.  While many references may conflate the two, it is very important to understand the difference: $\\Delta\\mathrm{mag}$ is what the universe gives you, while $C$ is what your instrument is designed to do.  Given the instrument's contrast, we can compute the count rate due to the star's residual (unblocked) light as:\n","$$\\bar{c}_{sr} =  C_\\mathrm{star} C A \\Delta\\lambda \\tau \\tau_\\mathrm{core} \\mathrm{QE}$$\n","\n","Finally, we have background signal that is generated by the detector itself.  Modeling of detectors can get arbitrarily complicated, as there is a *lot* of very specific (and fascinating) physics in play here.  This is especially true when considering photon-counting detectors (literally devices that can, on average, track every individual photon intercepted).  Here, we will limit ourselves to two instrumental noise signals: dark current and read noise. Dark current is the signal generated by a detector when it is not illuminated, while read noise consists of excess electrons that are generated by the process of reading out the detector (that is, literally collecting all of the light accumulated in the detector and converting it to a digital signal).  Both of these are (on average) per-pixel effects, and so we need to know the relevant number of pixels we should be computing these for.  This requires us to define the number of pixels covered by our photometric aperture:\n","$$N_\\mathrm{pix} = \\frac{\\Omega}{\\theta_\\mathrm{det}^2}$$\n","where $\\theta_\\mathrm{det}$ is the detector's pixel scale (the instantaneous field of view of each detector pixel).\n","The dark current count rate is then:\n","$$\\bar{c}_\\mathrm{dark} = N_\\mathrm{pix} i_\\mathrm{dark}$$\n","where $i_\\mathrm{dark}$ is the dark current rate, measured in counts/second/pixel.\n","\n","All of the preceding count rates have come from processes that are (or can be safely modeled as) continuous.  That is, for our astrophysical sources and starlight residual and dark current, we are accumulating photons (counts or digital numbers) throughout the length of an observation that have some average arrival rate, such that we can multiply these rates by the total integration time to get the expectation value for our recorded signal.  Read noise, however, is different as it represents a *discrete* process.  Counts due to read noise are only generated when we read out our detector.  We could do this once per observation, but that tends to be a bad idea because of the accumulation of cosmic rays, which tend to saturate our detector, as well as some other more finicky effects. So, in typical usage, we will read out our detector multiple times within the span of a single observation, and then sum the results.  To model this, we introduce the exposure time ($t_\\mathrm{exp}$) parameter, which encodes the duration of each readout exposure.  The number of readouts is therefore given by $t_\\mathrm{int}/t_\\mathrm{exp}$. Because we have the integration time in the numerator, we can still compute a 'rate' for the contribution of the read noise, which will have the form:\n","$$\\bar{c}_\\mathrm{read} = N_\\mathrm{pix} \\frac{i_\\mathrm{read}}{t_\\mathrm{exp}}$$\n","where $i_\\mathrm{read}$ is the read noise in units of electrons/pixel/readout."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"95f1f1a1-1d05-4813-b390-e3464e085d4b","metadata":{"id":"95f1f1a1-1d05-4813-b390-e3464e085d4b"},"source":["## Modeling the Noise Floor\n","\n","Perhaps the most difficult aspect of all of this to model is the noise floor ($M$). Conceptually, this term represents the part of the background signal that cannot be subtracted or otherwise removed from our measurements.  This implies that this term has to do with a variability in our optical system that we cannot model.  Formally, we can describe this as a variability in our instrument's **point spread function** (or impulse response).  The actual part of the background signal that will be most affected by such variability is the residual starlight that cannot be full suppressed.  We know, thanks to experience with high-performance, ground-based coronagraphs as well as space-based instrument on the Hubble and other observatories that we are able to subtract the contributions of some, but not all of this term, so we define a new variable, called the post-processing factor ($f_p$) such that:\n","$$M = \\bar{c}_{sr} f_p \\,.$$\n","The post-processing factor should be interpreted as the reciprocal of our expected ability to suppress residual starlight, such that $f_p = 0.1$ represents the assumption that our intrinsic noise floor lies at a factor of 10 below the residual starlight."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"44a81625-3185-40be-b3a7-be2f3b1dcc1b","metadata":{"id":"44a81625-3185-40be-b3a7-be2f3b1dcc1b"},"source":["## Exercise 7\n","\n","We now have all of the equations we need in order to implement a calculation of the planet, background, and noise floor count rates (the inputs to our previously written integration time calculation), so let's do just that.  First, a few implementation notes.  As you can see, there are a *lot* of inputs.  To make our lives a little easier, we will package these into three dictionaries: `static_params` (the values we expect to be more or less constant between different observations), `coronagraph` (values encoding the performance of the starlight suppression system) and `target` (values encoding the particulars of a given observation). Defining these dictionaries serves to prevent errors due to keeping track of the position of a lot of required inputs.\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n","<b>Warning</b> A key thing to keep in mind is that much of the modeling described in the previous section is greatly simplified, and omits a lot of finicky details that become important as you try to compute realistic integration times and count rates. Furthermore, many of the values (such as all of the coronagraph parameters and some of the detector parametrs) are not actually constants, but depend on other parameters such as wavelength, and the separation angles between the star and the planet. Our various simplifications are fine in the context of this tutorial, but be careful in trying to apply any of this in the real world.\n","</div>\n","\n","You'll also note that there are a lot of units floating around these calculations.  We will again make use of `astropy`'s `Unit` class (https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/) to help us, but these still have some limitations.  Most importantly, you cannot use an `astropy` `Quantity` object in an exponent, so we will omit the units on the zodi and exozodi brightness inputs.  Similarly, mathematical operations on quantities with units will work as expected, but may produce results with mixed units (for example nanometers divided by meters).  Every `Quantity` object has a useful built-in method called `decompose()` which will automatically resolve such mixtures to a single base unit.  Similarly, if you ever wish to extract the unit or value of a given quantity object `q`, you can call `q.unit` and `q.value`, respectively.\n","\n","One more important note on units: there are cases where you divide two length units and expect the result to be an angle quantity (for example $\\lambda/D$ is an angle such that if both inputs have the same length unit, the output is in radians).
